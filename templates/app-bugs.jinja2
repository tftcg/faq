<li><s>Energon Edition Cliffjumper uses Energon Edition Bumblebee's imagery. </s></li>
<li><s>All Wave 5 Battle Cards are Actions, including the Upgrades and Secret Actions. </s></li>

<li><s>If you add Arcee to your team, then switch to the game mode and try to convert her to bot-mode, the game offers a feature to Form Sergeant Six-Gun. When you do this you get Raider Brunt. </s></li>
<li><s>If you add both Skytread pieces to your deck and switch to the game section (Green arrow), they automatically combine. </s></li>
<li><s>In general it has a star-math error when moving back and forth between app sections. For example, if you add the two pieces of Raider Brunt to your deck, or the two pieces of Sergeant Six-Gun, then switch to game mode, then switch back and remove them, you will have gained a 11 or 9 stars that can't be removed. </s></li>
<li><s>Head on Collision, Stable Cover, Solder's Blaster and Special Delivery all show in the blue battle icon filter. </s></li>

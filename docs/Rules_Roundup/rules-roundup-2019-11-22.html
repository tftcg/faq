My opponent just went and used “Peace Through Tyranny” and KO’d his Lionizer...putting it on Spinister. Pteraxadon was already tapped. He then attacked with Spinister and KO’d my Scamper. My Metroplex is still untapped. My opponent has another turn from the PTT. How does that work seeing he’s all tapped out, but I still have a character that’s untapped?

      <div class="answer">
        
Because the Safeguard value is the same, having two instances of it has no additional effect. Smokescreen can’t take more than 3 damage if undamaged. However, if a character has two instances of Safeguard with different values, the lowest value wins. For example, if a character has Safeguard 1 and Safeguard 3, that character can’t take more than 1 damage if undamaged.

Here's what happens. Your opponent starts to play Brainstorm, this causes Nightbird’s ability to trigger, but that effect doesn’t resolve immediately. Continuing to resolve Brainstorm, your opponent then plays System Reboot. Another Nightbird trigger happens, which, again, doesn’t resolve immediately. The System Reboot resolves, causing Shockwave to trigger four times. Continuing to resolve Brain Storm, your opponent then plays the second System Reboot. This causes another Nightbird trigger. The second System Reboot causes another four Shockwave triggers. Now that Brainstorm has resolved, we start resolving triggers, beginning with the ones that triggered most recently and working backwards. The four Shockwave triggers caused by the second System Reboot happen one at a time. Next, the Nightbird trigger caused by the second System Reboot happens. Next, the Shockwave triggers caused by the first System Reboot happens. Next, the Nightbird trigger caused by the first System Reboot happens. And finally, the Nightbird trigger caused by the Brain Storm happens. At any point, if resolving one of these triggers causes a player to KO their last character, that player loses the game. If Shockwave was at 3 and Nightbird was at 8 at the beginning of this sequence, Nightbird is going to lose.

If your opponent is entirely tapped out, you must attack with both characters. If not, you can attack with one or the other (not both), but you don’t have to.

Let's say I've got an Armor on one of my characters as well as Defensive Configuration, giving me an extra empty Armor slot. I then play Hunker Down which checks to see if I have an Armor or not. Since Configuration will be giving me an empty Armor slot, would I be able to put an Armor on my character through Hunker, or will it not work since I do still have an Armor in the 1st Armor slot?

Interesting Sergeant Six-Gun question. If I have both of his Upgrades on one character, and say an Armor in his Armor slot (so in this case Six-Gun’s Upgrades are in Weapon and Utility, respectively), can I scrap said armor to put on a Utility? One of his guns says you can put in Armor or Utility slots but I'm not sure if you could scrap one to play the other.

My question is about the interaction of Debilitating Crystal and the new Expanded Rules document. If my attacker has a Debilitating Crystal, and the Defender has a Gyro Blaster I wish to return, I believe the Gyro Blaster would still limit each character to 2 flips this battle. Is this correct? I know a previous Rules Roundup clarified that a Security Console would still Draw and Plan even if a Debilitating Crystal returned it. Is this also the case with a Sparring Gear I wish to return? Do they still have Tough 2 this battle?

Expanded Rules point 8.5 indicates the Gyro Blaster is returned before flips are determined, so it will not affect them. Likewise, Sparring Gear will no longer grant Tough 2 when flips are determined.

Beginning player here, not sure where else to go for clarification in general. My buddy and I played a killer game with Insecticons (me) v Special Ops Specialists (buddy). All three of his characters had Safeguard. I swung into one of them (undamaged) with Raider Kickback (bot) and flipped one blue and several orange. My thinking was the one damage from Kickback's ability would eliminate the Safeguard, thus allowing all combat damage to be applied. Then came the confusion. I believe his thinking was that all the damage came at once, prevented to some degree by Safeguard. After scouring stupid Google for help to no avail, I decided to simply concede to his perspective and move the game along. He won, but it was close, and it would have been a drastically different story had all that combat damage been applied.
Kickback’s ability does 1 Damage before Attack damage is applied, thus disabling Safeguard. Congratulations on your crushing theoretical victory!
Do you need to have the character in Bot mode showing the Bounty for this card to use the bounty. Or does the card activate the character’s Bounty regardless of mode?

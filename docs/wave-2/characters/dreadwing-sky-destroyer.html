        What are <a href="/keywords/combiner.html">Combiner</a>s?
        <span><a class="source_link" href="https://transformerstcg.hasbro.com/en-us/howtoplay" title="Wave 2 and 3 FAQ">[Source: WotC]</a> <a href="#Wave-2-3__1"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>

      <div class="answer">
        It would be hard to have a set called Rise of the <a href="/keywords/combiner.html">Combiner</a>s without… the Combiners!<br/>Combiners are teams of characters that join in a third mode called Combiner mode. Most teams have a corresponding battle card called an Enigma that combines the team under the right circumstances. One Combiner in this set (Dreadwing - Sky Destroyer) has a different way of combining.<br/>When a character is combined, it starts untapped and it gets all the damage counters from the characters that formed it. It can keep upgrades from those characters based on its upgrade slots. Unless the Combiner says differently, it will have 1 Weapon slot, 1 Utility slot, and 1 Armor slot like most characters. If there are too many Upgrades to fit into a slot, you can keep as many as you can fit, and the rest are scrapped.<br/>A character in Combiner mode is a single character, even though it’s made up of multiple cards.  When it attacks, the whole thing becomes tapped. If it’s KO’d (and somehow you haven’t lost the game), it stays in Combiner mode in the KO area.<br/>A character in Combiner mode can’t flip. Ignore any instruction to flip it. Also, a character in Combiner mode can’t “break apart” into its individual cards.

        Finally, how does Dreadwing - Sky Destroyer’s combine ability work with this scenario? Does the “untap step” happen before the end of turn step? Do they happen in a sequence of the active player’s choice? Or does the untapping of all characters happen even before this?

      <div class="answer">
        Characters untap before the end of turn step, so you both players would untap all of their characters, then you could combine Dreadwing, then your opponent could start their turn.

        If Dreadwing - Sky Destroyer has 2 <a href="/wave-3/battle-cards/spinner-rims.html">Spinner Rims</a> attached and flips a white trigger on attacking, does he flip 1 extra battle card for each Spinner Rims attached, or just 1 extra?

      <div class="answer">
        Both copies of <a href="/wave-3/battle-cards/spinner-rims.html">Spinner Rims</a> will trigger and allow you to flip an extra Battle Card, for a total of two, in this scenario.

        With multiple <a href="/wave-3/battle-cards/anticipation-engine.html">Anticipation Engine</a>s and/or <a href="/wave-3/battle-cards/metal-detector.html">Metal Detector</a>s, you handle the abilities one at a time. If you have an Anticipation Engine and a Metal Detector, you must specify which one you are using before revealing the card. If the card you reveal doesn’t match the type of card you’re looking for, it just stays on top of your deck. The next ability will reveal the same card, so choose wisely.

        <a href="/wave-2/characters/dreadwind-air-defense.html">Dreadwind</a> and Blackwing are both in the K.O. Area. If you combine them, Dreadwing would still be K.O.'d.

      <div class="answer">
        <a href="/wave-2/characters/dreadwind-air-defense.html">Dreadwind</a> and Blackwing cannot be combined if they are both in the K.O. Area because their abilities won’t work. If you use <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/i-still-function!.html">I Still Function!</a> to return one of them to the Battlefield, at end of turn, two abilities happen: I Still Function K.O.’s the character and the combining ability of whichever character you brought back happens. If you combine first, then I Still Function! still applies and will K.O. a combined Dreadwing. If I Still Function! K.O.’s the character you brought back first, the combining ability won’t do anything, and you’ll have Dreadwind and Blackwing in K.O. separately. Essentially, you can have Dreadwing in K.O. or Dreadwind and Blackwing in K.O.

Your attack step is over, right? Can you not attack with Dreadwing the turn he comes into play in that case? Does your opponent take a turn and not attack because their characters are all tapped, or do you have to attack with Dreadwing the turn he comes into play since your opponent is tapped out?

        My question revolves around Dreadwing, and if there are 2 <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/security-console.html">Security Console</a>s equipped in the 2 Utility Slots. Would you resolve each Security Console's effects one at a time? Or would you Draw 2 Cards and then Plan 2? (As each Security Console gives lets your Draw a card then Plan 1)

        Multiple <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/security-console.html">Security Console</a>s should be resolved one at a time. Their effects do not combine. If you put a card on the top of your deck from the first one, be sure to act surprised when you draw it again.

        If Dreadwing has two <a href="/wave-3/battle-cards/force-field.html">Force Field</a>s equipped, wouldn't they both be scrapped at the same time? If a character would take 5 or more attack damage, both Force Fields would be triggered. Then you resolve them one at a time, in the order of your choice. The first one would scrap and reduce damage taken to 4. The second would scrap but the damage was already reduced to 4. This follows the Dinobot Sludge + <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/data-pad.html">Data Pad</a> ruling where both effects are triggered at attack, and even if Data Pad puts your hand equal to your opponent, you still resolve Sludge's ability to draw 2 cards. Correct?

        Does the <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/i-still-function!.html">I Still Function!</a> + Dreadwing rule apply generally to <a href="/keywords/combiner.html">Combiner</a>s or is it specific to Dreadwing’s method of Combination? Suppose I control <a href="/wave-1/characters/dinobot-sludge-mighty-stomper.html">Dinobot Sludge - Mighty Stomper</a> and have the five Dinobot components in my <a href="/keywords/ko.html">KO</a> Area. Can I <a href="/wave-3/battle-cards/brainstorm.html">Brainstorm</a>+ I Still Function! + <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/dinobot-enigma.html">Dinobot Enigma</a> and expect to keep <a href="/wave-2/characters/volcanicus-fiery-champion.html">Volcanicus</a> at the end of the turn?

        The same ruling applies. If you <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/i-still-function!.html">I Still Function!</a> One of the Dinobots and then play <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/dinobot-enigma.html">Dinobot Enigma</a>, at the end of your turn, <a href="/wave-2/characters/volcanicus-fiery-champion.html">Volcanicus</a> will be <a href="/keywords/ko.html">KO</a>’d.

      <div class="answer">
        Deck checks may be performed at any tournament at the option of the head judge. A deck check compares the deck registration list to the current contents of a player’s deck. If they do not match, appropriate penalties may be issued.

        Players are allowed to take written notes during a match and may refer to those notes while that match is in progress. At the beginning of a match, each player’s note sheet must be empty and must remain visible throughout the match. Players do not have to explain or reveal notes to other players. Judges may ask to see a player’s notes and/or request that the player explain their notes.<br/>Players may not refer to other notes, including notes from previous matches, during games.<br/>Between games, players may refer to a brief set of notes made before the match. They are not required to reveal these notes to their opponents. These notes must be removed from the play area before the beginning of the next game. Players taking excessive amounts of time reviewing notes may be subject to Slow Play penalties.

        How does Sideboarding work in Limited competitions (e.g. Sealed or Draft)?
        <span><a href="https://github.com/tftcg/faq"><img src="/images/source-blue.svg" title="Community"/></a> <a href="#Additional_FAQs__3"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        The Tournament Rules (2019-11-21) say that <i>"Players participating in Limited tournaments may freely change the composition of their decks between matches (but not games) by exchanging cards from their deck for other cards in their card pool without being required to return their deck to its original composition before their next match."</i>. 

              This is the expectation for regular instore play, however, for the Energon International it was determined that (in <a class="external" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/transformerstcg/permalink/2591276550907826/?comment_id=2591285324240282">this Facebook post</a>) that <i>"Players will need to return to their registered configuration prior to Game 1 of any match and they will be able to sideboard cards in during Games 2 &amp; 3."</i>

              Despite this expectation, most competitions appear to follow the Energon International format.

If all my opponent’s characters have already been tapped, can I still attack with the newly formed Combiner?<br/>If all of your opponent’s characters have already been tapped and you finish an attack with your untapped Combiner, you will then attack a second time with the Combiner.

    When <a href="/wave-3/battle-cards/bolster.html">Bolster</a> activates during my opponent’s turn, and Multi-Mission Gear is played with a Combiner Enigma, where does the attack land? As the defending character is no longer there, does it hit the Combiner?

My opponent has 3 untapped characters and taps their attacker, declaring Flamewar as my defender. Because the conditions are met, I reveal Bolster and play Multi-Mission Gear onto my Flamewar.

This kills my Flamewar but the attacker still lives. What happens in this scenario? Does my opponent lose their attack because the defender was killed prior to battle cards being flipped?

        For your consideration, <a href="/wave-3/characters/sergeant-cog-artillery-mechanic.html">Cog</a>. During your opponent's turn, they swing at and KO him. He attaches to one of your characters, leaving you with two. You draw your cards and find that you can attach a Multi-Mission Gear on a Specialist character, which of course you do thanks to his effect. With that Multi-Mission Gear, you decide to be rather aggressive and play a <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/peace-through-tyranny.html">Peace Through Tyranny</a>, KO’ing one of your characters to, and I quote, "take an extra turn after this one". <br/>Now, in the context that it's currently your opponent's turn, and that you're taking an extra turn after "this one", would that mean that your "extra turn" would actually just be your next regular turn since the "next turn" is just your regular turn or am I mistaken?

      <div class="answer">
        Let’s walk through this whole play. You play <a href="/wave-3/battle-cards/brainstorm.html">Brainstorm</a> and your first action is <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/ancient-wisdom.html">Ancient Wisdom</a>. Ancient Wisdom has you scrap the top two cards of your deck and put an Action and/or Upgrade from among the scrapped cards into your hand. At this point, you can play <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/unleash-potential.html">Unleash Potential</a>, if it’s in your hand.<br/>Let’s say you do. You get a card with 1 star from outside the game and put it into your hand. This may not be a great idea, because you then play the second action from Brainstorm, which is <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/system-reboot.html">System Reboot</a>. You scrap your hand (including that fancy star card you just snagged) and draw 4 cards.<br/>But instead, let’s say you don’t play Unleash Potential. That brings you to the end of Ancient Wisdom and now you System Reboot just as above.<br/>In either case, your new hand is Multi-Mission Gear, Brainstorm, and 2 Unleash Potentials. You’ve already played an Action this turn, so we’re guessing you’ll now play Multi-Mission Gear. This allows you to play an Action such as Brainstorm. Brainstorm will allow you to play 2 Unleash Potentials. You played Ancient Wisdom earlier in your turn, so you can get two 1-star cards from outside the game.

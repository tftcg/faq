                <h3>Playing Over Webcam</h3>
                <p>One way to play Transformers that is currently popular is to play via Webcams. There is a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/259946351679000">Facebook Group</a> to help get setup and arrange games. One popular approach, if you don't own a Webcam, is to use DroidCam on a phone (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dev47apps.droidcam">Android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/droidcam-wireless-webcam/id1510258102">iPhone</a>), that connects over WiFi to your computer, and then you use a channel like Discord to share video and chat with your opponent. </p>

                <h3>Playing in Store</h3>
                <p>While the COVID-19 Pandemic has forced us online, local game stores are reopening and a great place to buy cards and play games. If your local gaming group is large enough, they are likely to even be prepared to host competitions. If you search on Facebook, there are <a href="https://www.facebook.com/search/groups/?q=transformers tcg">many regional groups</a> dedicated to playing Transformers. </p>

                <h3>Conventions</h3>
                <p>Through 2019, Transformers was played at GenCon, Origins, and then at the Energon Invitiational at Pax Unplugged. A virtual tournament will be held at TFcon in October 2020. Hopefully there will be many more conference tournaments. </p>

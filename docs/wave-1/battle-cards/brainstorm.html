        Superior upgrades only check to see if you have played <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/tech-research.html">Tech Research</a> at some point previously in your turn. Therefore, there is no issue with playing other cards between Tech Research and a Superior upgrade.

        In this case, <a href="/wave-2/characters/volcanicus-fiery-champion.html">Volcanicus</a> has KO’d the defender before actually doing attack damage to it, so the attack will end with no attack damage dealt.

        I have 4 cards in my hand and my opponent has Decepticon Shockwave in Bot mode. If they play Brainstorm > <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/system-reboot.html">System Reboot</a> > System Reboot, do I take 4 damage after each System Reboot or 8 damage after Brainstorm is resolved?

        Shockwave’s ability will trigger a total of 8 times. Each of those abilities resolves separately, so essentially you have 8 damage counters to spread around as you wish.

        Using the above scenario, my character is Nightbird in alt mode. What is the timing there? Does the Shockwave player take 1 damage each time an action hits the play area or after the Brainstorm resolves?<br/>I.E. My Nightbird is at full HP (11) and his Shockwave is at 3.  Who wins?

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Here's what happens. Your opponent starts to play Brainstorm, this causes Nightbird’s ability to trigger, but that effect doesn’t resolve immediately. Continuing to resolve Brainstorm, your opponent then plays <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/system-reboot.html">System Reboot</a>. Another Nightbird trigger happens, which, again, doesn’t resolve immediately. The System Reboot resolves, causing Shockwave to trigger four times. Continuing to resolve Brain Storm, your opponent then plays the second System Reboot. This causes another Nightbird trigger. The second System Reboot causes another four Shockwave triggers. Now that Brainstorm has resolved, we start resolving triggers, beginning with the ones that triggered most recently and working backwards. The four Shockwave triggers caused by the second System Reboot happen one at a time. Next, the Nightbird trigger caused by the second System Reboot happens. Next, the Shockwave triggers caused by the first System Reboot happens. Next, the Nightbird trigger caused by the first System Reboot happens. And finally, the Nightbird trigger caused by the Brain Storm happens. At any point, if resolving one of these triggers causes a player to KO their last character, that player loses the game. If Shockwave was at 3 and Nightbird was at 8 at the beginning of this sequence, Nightbird is going to lose.

        You use it before the game begins. After you put the Brainstorm into your hand, you’ll shuffle the rest of your deck. Then you’ll draw the normal 3 cards at the start of the game.

        Does "outside the game" refer to the sideboard?

        It can refer to your sideboard, however your “outside the game” cards do not have to be in your sideboard to be considered detectable by the game.<br/>In resolving the Brainstorm, you will play both <a href="/wave-3/battle-cards/defensive-formation.html">Defensive Formation</a>s. Skywarp’s ability will trigger for each of them, but you won’t draw cards for the ability until you’ve finished resolving the Brainstorm.

Hunker Down flips all 3 to alt mode, then I play armors from the scrap pile if able. Once Hunker Down is complete, I play Rapid Conversion targeting Megatron to flip him into bot mode. Brainstorm is now resolved. Moving on to character triggers, would Demolisher’s ability now draw 1 or 2 cards? Would I be allowed to use Megatron’s flip ability?

        Let's say you have a team of combiners. And your opponent’s characters are all tapped out. You have one character untapped and all of your characters are in bot mode. I know you can’t use <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/inferno-breath.html">Inferno Breath</a> in this instance because you wouldn’t be able to attack to end the turn. However, if you play Brainstorm and then play Inferno Breath, tapping your last character and then using the Brainstorm’s second effect to play and enigma and combine, is that a legal play?

      <div class="answer">
        In this scenario, you actually could play <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/inferno-breath.html">Inferno Breath</a> because you can tap your last character. When it comes time to attack, if you have no untapped characters, your turn would end. If your opponent also has no untapped character, you would untap all characters as usual and your opponent’s turn would begin. If you play the enigma and combine your characters into a Combiner, the Combiner begins untapped, so it would be the character that attacks.

        Would playing multiple instances of <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/steamroll.html">Steamroll</a> in the same turn allow for damage, if it were high enough to KO the second character as well as the initial character that was knocked out, to carry over to a second or third target? For example: Brainstorm into two Steamrolls or play Steamroll and then flip <a href="/wave-2/characters/bumblebee-trusted-lieutenant.html">Bumblebee - Trusted Lieutenant</a> into alt-mode and play a second or even a third Steamroll (if Brainstorm was played first).

      <div class="answer">
        Let’s walk through this whole play. You play Brainstorm and your first action is <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/ancient-wisdom.html">Ancient Wisdom</a>. Ancient Wisdom has you scrap the top two cards of your deck and put an Action and/or Upgrade from among the scrapped cards into your hand. At this point, you can play <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/unleash-potential.html">Unleash Potential</a>, if it’s in your hand.<br/>Let’s say you do. You get a card with 1 star from outside the game and put it into your hand. This may not be a great idea, because you then play the second action from Brainstorm, which is <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/system-reboot.html">System Reboot</a>. You scrap your hand (including that fancy star card you just snagged) and draw 4 cards.<br/>But instead, let’s say you don’t play Unleash Potential. That brings you to the end of Ancient Wisdom and now you System Reboot just as above.<br/>In either case, your new hand is <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/multi-mission-gear.html">Multi-Mission Gear</a>, Brainstorm, and 2 Unleash Potentials. You’ve already played an Action this turn, so we’re guessing you’ll now play Multi-Mission Gear. This allows you to play an Action such as Brainstorm. Brainstorm will allow you to play 2 Unleash Potentials. You played Ancient Wisdom earlier in your turn, so you can get two 1-star cards from outside the game.

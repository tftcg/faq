        <h3 class="card_title">Known Bugs in the Mobile App</h3>

<ol>
<li>The Sky Shadow pieces are inverted. The Plane shows when Tank is filtered for, and the Tank when Plane is filtered for. </li>
</ol>

        <h3 class="card_title">Fixed Bugs in the Mobile App</h3>
<ol>
<li><s>Wipe-Out has Jurassic Punch as the alt thumbnail image. </s></li>
<li><s>Wipe-Out is 6 star cost in the app, should be 4 star. </s></li>
<li><s>The Beast trait is prefixed with a ' ' in the Character filter. </s></li>
<li><s>Stratagems all appear to be configured as Common, breaking the Stratagem filter. </s></li>
<li><s>Combiners have no ownership notion; listing your unowned cards always shows the combiners. </s></li>
<li><s>Raider Skytread has no card. </s></li>
<li><s>Images are sometimes replaced with white or black block images after looking at the card; (for example Fortress Maximus/Sky Shadow-combined). (iOS and Android)</s></li>
<li><s>Flintlock is 3 star cost in the app, should be 4 star. </s></li>
<li><s>Topspin's alt mode (thumb and full) lack his star cost. </s></li>
<li><s>Arcana is Common in the app, should be Rare. </s></li>
<li><s>Tidal Wave (all three pieces) are Common in the app, should be Rare. </s></li>
<li><s>Hand-to-Hand Combat is Common in the app, should be Uncommon. </s></li>
<li><s>Handheld Blaster is Uncommon in the app, should be Common. </s></li>
<li><s>Handheld Blaster and Hand-to-Hand Combat appear to be swapped in the Stats section. </s></li>
<li><s>Energon Edition Cliffjumper uses Energon Edition Bumblebee's imagery. </s></li>
<li><s>All Wave 5 Battle Cards are Actions, including the Upgrades and Secret Actions. </s></li>
<li><s>"Attack Bonus" battle card keyword is very vague. Immersed in Shadow, Point Position, Step Forward are odd examples. </s></li>
<li><s>Brass Knuckles is not listed as Bold. </s></li>
<li><s>Spiked Bracelet is not listed as Tough. </s></li>
<li><s>No card from any wave is listed as Health. </s></li>
<li><s>Headbutt is listed as Orange instead of Black. </s></li>
<li><b>POST END OF SUPPORT:</b></li>
<li>Lucky Dodge is 0 star cost in the app, should be 1 star. </li>
<li>Crystal of Power does not appear when you filter for Weapon. (WEAPON ARMOR was added)</li>
<li>Brave Keyword: Battlefield Scan is missing. </li>
<li>Stealth Keyword: Battlefield Scan and Hiding Spot are missing. </li>
<li>You can't swipe between cards in the Stratagem section. </li>
<li>Cerebros is a Specialist in the app. </li>
<li>The Sky Shadow pieces don't show when Plane and Tank are filtered for. </li>
<li>The "Attack Bonus" battle keyword is improved, though not all cards that could show are showing. For example Head-On Collision as a positive attack bonus, and Emergency Defense Field as negative attack bonus. (EXAMPLES AT LEAST FIXED)</li>
<li>If you add Arcee to your team, then switch to the game mode and try to convert her to bot-mode, the game offers a feature to Form Sergeant Six-Gun. When you do this you get Raider Brunt. </li>
<li>If you add both Skytread pieces to your deck and switch to the game section (Green arrow), they automatically combine. </li>
<li>In general it has a star-math error when moving back and forth between app sections. For example, if you add the two pieces of Raider Brunt to your deck, or the two pieces of Sergeant Six-Gun, then switch to game mode, then switch back and remove them, you will have gained a 11 or 9 stars that can't be removed. </li>
<li>Head on Collision, Stable Cover, Solder's Blaster and Special Delivery all show in the blue battle icon filter. </li>
</ol>

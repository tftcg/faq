      <question>I noticed that Omega Supreme (Base) doesn&#x2019;t have an ability to combine into Captain Omega Supreme. What happens if both the Spaceship and Tank are KO&#x2019;d before I get the chance to combine?</question>
      <answer>The combine abilities don&#x2019;t work from the KO area, so in that case your Base would be left standing alone. Unless you have a way to bring the Spaceship or the Tank back onto the battlefield, you won&#x2019;t be able to combine them into Captain Omega Supreme. Good luck!</answer>

      <question>The Spaceship and the Tank have very similar abilities to combine into Captain Omega Supreme. What happens if my opponent reshuffles their deck and both abilities would apply?</question>
      <answer>Captain Omega Supreme can only be combined once. The redundant ability is ignored.</answer>

      <question>What happens if my last two characters are those two and they&#x2019;re both KO&#x2019;d at the same time. Dpo their Revenge abilities work and keep me in the game?</question>
      <answer>Unfortunately, no. Once your last character is KO&#x2019;d, you lose the game. Fortunately, having them both KO&#x2019;d at the same time is pretty unusual.</answer>

      <question>Both Revenge abilities put cards from my hand under Raider Skytread. What does this mean?</question>
      <answer>The cards under Raider Skytread are basically out of play for a while. They&#x2019;re not considered on the battlefield, even if that&#x2019;s where they are physically, so none of their abilities apply. If one of those cards is an Upgrade, that Upgrade isn&#x2019;t on Raider Skytread, and so on. They&#x2019;re also not in your scrap pile, so they won&#x2019;t be shuffled into your deck when it&#x2019;s empty. They can return to your hand using Raider Skytread&#x2019;s last ability.</answer>

      <question>Each of Captain Astrotrain&#x2019;s abilities triggers if he has a certain number of Upgrades. What happens if the ability triggers, but then his Upgrades are scrapped during the attack?</question>
      <answer>Once the ability triggers, it doesn&#x2019;t matter how many Upgrades Captain Astrotrain has. He&#x2019;ll keep the specified bonus until end of turn.</answer>

    <entry mode="alt">
      <question>What happens if I have fewer than 5 cards in my deck when I flip Captain Jetfire to alt mode?</question>
      <answer>In that case you&#x2019;ll reveal as many cards as you can from your deck, then&#x2014;leaving those cards aside&#x2014;shuffle your scrap pile to rebuild your deck. Then reveal more cards so a total of 5 are revealed. The revealed cards that aren&#x2019;t Upgrades will be only cards in your scrap pile when you&#x2019;re done.</answer>

      <question>Lockdown&#x2019;s Bounty ability puts a card from the bottom of my deck under himself. What does it mean when a card is under Lockdown?</question>
      <answer>The cards under Lockdown are basically out of play for a while. They&#x2019;re not considered on the battlefield, even if that&#x2019;s where they are physically, so none of their abilities apply. If one of those cards is an Upgrade, that Upgrade isn&#x2019;t on Lockdown, and so on. They&#x2019;re also not in your scrap pile, so they won&#x2019;t be shuffled into your deck when it&#x2019;s empty. They&#x2019;re just used to keep track of the bonuses from Lockdown&#x2019;s other abilities.</answer>

    <entry mode="bot">
      <question>Can I look at the card as it&#x2019;s put under Lockdown?</question>
      <answer>No. The card is face-down, so neither player can look at it while it&#x2019;s under Lockdown.</answer>

      <question>What happens to the cards under Lockdown if he is KO&#x2019;d?</question>

  <target name="Lord Megatron - Conqueror of Cybertron">
    <entry mode="alt">
      <question>What happens if my opponent doesn&#x2019;t have enough cards in their deck to scrap?</question>
      <answer>In that case, your opponent scraps all the cards in their deck. Then, setting those cards aside, they shuffle all the other cards in their scrap pile into their deck. Then they scrap enough cards from their reformed deck to scrap the total number of cards they were supposed to. In most cases, however many cards they were supposed to scrap will be the number of cards in their scrap pile after Megatron&#x2019;s ability is finished. Sorry, after Lord Megatron&#x2019;s ability is finished.</answer>

      <question>What does &#x201C;reshuffles their deck&#x201D; mean?</question>
      <answer>Reshuffling your deck is when you shuffle your scrap pile into your deck because your deck is empty. If you shuffle your deck for another reason, that&#x2019;s not &#x201C;reshuffling your deck.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s just shuffling your deck.</answer>

      <question>Although it&#x2019;s unlikely, let&#x2019;s say my opponent&#x2019;s deck runs out of cards, but there are no cards in their scrap pile. What happens?</question>
      <answer>If there are no cards in their scrap pile, they can&#x2019;t reshuffle their deck, so Megatron . . . sorry, Lord Megatron&#x2019;s ability won&#x2019;t trigger.</answer>

      <question>If I have a Weapon in my hand that gives an attack bonus because of an ability in its text box, will that bonus count for Six-Gun&#x2019;s ability?</question>

    <entry mode="bot">
      <question>This Weapon can be in an Armor or Utility slot. When I play it, do I have to say which slot it&#x2019;s in?</question>
      <answer>Yes. Usually, players indicate which slot an Upgrade is in by placing it on a particular side of the character: Weapons on the left, Armors on the right, and Utilities below. Once the Upgrade is in a slot, it can&#x2019;t be moved to another slot to free up space.</answer>

      <question>If MXT-S2A Guided Missile Launcher is put into an Armor slot, does it then count as an Armor?</question>

Then scrap enough cards from your reformed deck to scrap a total of 4 cards. The cards that aren&#x2019;t Upgrades will be only cards in your scrap pile when you&#x2019;re done.</answer>

    <entry mode="bot">
      <question>How does Private Vanguard&#x2019;s ability interact with effects that modify how much attack damage a character takes, such as Blast Suit.</question>
      <answer>That ability doesn&#x2019;t directly modify how much attack damage is being done to the character (note it doesn&#x2019;t use &#x201C;instead&#x201D;), so it waits for effects like Blast Suit to apply, then sees if the character is taking more than 5 attack damage. If it is, the character takes 5 attack damage.</answer>

    <entry mode="bot">
      <question>Sergeant Barricade&#x2019;s ability puts a flipped card under himself instead of into your scrap pile. What does it mean when a card is under Sergeant Barricade?</question>
      <answer>The card under Sergeant Barricade is basically out of play for a bit (at least, until you play it using the alt ode ability). While the card is under Sergeant Barricade, it&#x2019;s not considered on the battlefield, even if that&#x2019;s where it is physically, so none of its abilities apply. If the card is an Upgrade, that Upgrade isn&#x2019;t on Sergeant Barricade, and so on. It&#x2019;s also not in your scrap pile, so it won&#x2019;t be shuffled into your deck when it&#x2019;s empty.</answer>

      <question>Several cards in this set put battle cards under characters on the battlefield. If my opponent does this, and one of those cards is a Secret Action, will Sergeant Mirage&#x2019;s ability see it and give him Tough 2?</question>
      <answer>No. Sergeant Mirage&#x2019;s ability looks only in the played area. Secret Actions that somehow end up in your opponent&#x2019;s KO area, scrap pile, or under a character on the battlefield don&#x2019;t count.</answer>

        The opponent had an <a href="/wave-1/characters/optimus-prime-battlefield-legend.html">Optimus Prime - Battlefield Legend</a> with an Anticipation Engine and attacked my Ramhorn.

        I have 2 untapped cars and a Wave 2 Bumblebee tapped in bot mode. I play Ready for Action untapping him. I then flip him, triggering his mode ability and I play <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/all-out-attack.html">All-Out Attack</a> allowing all my character to attack this turn as they are now all untapped prior me playing All-Out Attack (AOA). I put Anticipation Engine on one of my characters. I then attack with Bee first (tapping him), my 2nd character (tapping him), and finally the last character with Anticipation Engine (AE) which then taps him. AE triggers and I get <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/start-your-engines.html">Start Your Engines</a> (SYE). I untap that last character with AE. Seeing how AOA was played during a time where all my characters were untapped, does that last character get to attack again since it was untapped with SYE post AOA being played?

        If the opponent has no untapped characters, you will attack again with the last character. If the opponent has at least one untapped character, you cannot attack again with the last character. All Out Attack allows one attack with each of your untapped characters at the time you play it.

        The question I have today is in regard to attacking with Anticipation Engine. I am playing with a combiner team, and I have just converted my last character. I don't have the Enigma in my hand to play it, so I play a different action instead. I attack using a character with Anticipation Engine and flip the Enigma. Am I able to play it, transform, and continue the attack with the Combiner, or does my attack get cancelled and it becomes my opponent's turn? (This is because the Enigma has the Combiner enter play untapped)

Update to the question, as I see it was already answered in a previous Rules Round-up.

“Anticipation Engine + Enigma = Transformed and attacking, but untappedYou said the character was untapped, but still attacking. Does this mean that my opponent can only attack with one character if they have multiple available?

        I have a question about the interaction between Anticipation Engine and the Enigmas. Let’s say <a href="/wave-2/characters/silverbolt-aerialbot-leader.html">Silverbolt</a> has an Anticipation Engine equipped and the Aerialbots are all in bot mode. He attacks and flips the <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/aerialbot-enigma.html">Aerialbot Enigma</a>. What happens now? If the Aerialbots combine to form Superion does the attack continue, and if so, what is the base attack used to compute damage? Is it Superion’s attack or Silverbolt’s?

        The attack continues, except now Superion (untapped) is attacking the target <a href="/wave-2/characters/silverbolt-aerialbot-leader.html">Silverbolt</a> was previously attacking. Superion’s attack will be used to calculate damage.

        And to go one step further, as the Enigma is revealed by Anticipation Engine and not as part of the attack, is it correct you can’t take advantage of the green pip to send it to hand?
        <span><a class="source_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/transformers-trading-card-game/rules-roundup-628-wave-3-faq/2219655931489553/" title="Rules Roundup 2019-06-28">[Source: WotC]</a> <a href="#Rules_Roundup-2019-06-28__628-6"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>

        That is correct. The card revealed by Anticipation Engine’s ability is not considered a card flipped during battle, so its green battle icon would not work.

        If a card says reveal does it come into play or go back to the top. Example if I have Anticipation Engine and I reveal an upgrade does it stay in the play area until the end of turn, or go to the top of deck?

        With multiple Anticipation Engines and/or <a href="/wave-3/battle-cards/metal-detector.html">Metal Detector</a>s, you handle the abilities one at a time. If you have an Anticipation Engine and a Metal Detector, you must specify which one you are using before revealing the card. If the card you reveal doesn’t match the type of card you’re looking for, it just stays on top of your deck. The next ability will reveal the same card, so choose wisely.

        Since it sounds like (understandably) that a comprehensive rules document might take a while, perhaps you could answer a more specific timing question then.

Taken to a corner case, how would a player properly process an attack in the following scenario.

Your team:

<a href="/wave-3/characters/specialist-flamewar-special-ops-hunter.html">Specialist Flamewar</a> in bot mode equipped with an Anticipation Engine in her weapon slot, a <a href="/wave-3/battle-cards/metal-detector.html">Metal Detector</a> in her Utility slot. She has Focus 2 from her bot mode ability.

Her teammate, Raider Aimless has a <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/decepticon-crown.html">Decepticon Crown</a> equipped in his Utility slot giving out Plan 1 when a Decepticon attacks.

Her other teammate General Optimus Prime is in Alt Mode giving Bold 1 and Tough 1 to his teammates.

What would be the proper sequence of triggers when Specialist Flamewar initiates an attack? Which goes first Plan, Focus, the Equipment Triggers? Which Equipment Triggers first? Can both trigger on the same combat if you have an equipment and an action (or vice versa) as your top 2 cards?

      <div class="answer">
        When <a href="/wave-3/characters/specialist-flamewar-special-ops-hunter.html">Specialist Flamewar</a> attacks, the abilities of Anticipation Engine, <a href="/wave-3/battle-cards/metal-detector.html">Metal Detector</a>, and <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/decepticon-crown.html">Decepticon Crown</a> will all trigger. As the attacking player, you will resolve all of those abilities in the order of your choosing, one at a time. Then you will use your Focus ability. Then, you will flip battle cards, including an extra from General Optimus’ Bold 1.

(This is because the Enigma has the Combiner enter play untapped) Update to the question, as I see it was already answered in a previous Rules Round-up.<br/>Anticipation Engine + Enigma = Transformed and attacking, but untapped<br/>You said the character was untapped, but still attacking. Does this mean that my opponent can only attack with one character if they have multiple available?

        Character X attacks with Anticipation Engine. They flip <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/supercharge.html">Supercharge</a>. Is Bold 3 applied and will they flip 3 extra cards? Bold/Tough are locked in once the first battle flip begins?

        Anticipation Engine’s ability triggers before you flip battle cards, therefore <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/supercharge.html">Supercharge</a> will increase your bold.

        How does <a href="/wave-4/battle-cards/pincer-movement.html">Pincer Movement</a> work?  If I have three untapped Decepticons and play Pincer Movement, do I get to attack the same enemy with each of my Decepticons in sequence, or do I only get one extra attack total.  If I can get multiple attacks this way, and I untap one of the previously attacking Decepticons (such as via Anticipation Engine revealing Ready for Action), can that Decepticon attack again?

      <div class="answer">
        <a href="/wave-4/battle-cards/pincer-movement.html">Pincer Movement</a> gives you only one additional attack. After you play it, the next time one of your Decepticons attacks an enemy this turn, you’ll get the extra attack after the current attack.

        When you use <a href="/wave-4/battle-cards/sabotaged-armaments.html">Sabotaged Armaments</a>, and your opponent has a <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/power-punch.html">Power Punch</a> on the attacker, do they get the Bold before Sabotaged Armaments activates?

      <div class="answer">
        No. This all happens before Battle Cards are flipped.<br/>Speaking of which, what happens when a character upgraded with Anticipation Engine swings into a <a href="/wave-4/battle-cards/sabotaged-armaments.html">Sabotaged Armaments</a>?<br/>Anticipation Engine and Sabotaged Armaments will both trigger at the same time. The attacker will resolve Anticipation Engine first, then the defender will resolve Sabotaged Armaments.

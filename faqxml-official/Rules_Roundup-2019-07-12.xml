I was playing with Bombshell - Decepticon Psy Ops with 5 health left, against Shockwave - Cybertron Commander. I scrapped 11 cards to KO him, but should his bot mode ability have triggered, killing me in the process?
</question>
      <answer>
Shockwave&#x2019;s ability will trigger 11 times, but if those are the last two characters on the battlefield, your opponent will lose the game because Shockwave has been KO&#x2019;d by Bombshell&#x2019;s ability, but Bombshell is not yet KO&#x2019;d by Shockwave&#x2019;s ability.

      <question>
Does Skywarp &#x2013; Teleporting Seeker&#x2019;s bot mode ability trigger when playing a Secret Action from hand since the pip color is hidden information from your opponent? Will his bot mode ability trigger if it is played from the top of the deck via Leap of Faith since the pip color is no longer hidden information?
</question>
      <answer>
Yes, Skywarp&#x2019;s bot mode ability would be triggered by a Secret Action as the battle icon color is hidden. It will still trigger if Leap of Faith plays a Secret Action because at the time you play the Secret Action, the Secret Action has no battle icons (it&#x2019;s not very secret).

      <question>
Can you scrap cards from your hand? This came up from playing a lot of the Turbo format with my kids. Inevitably someone had one or two cards that you couldn&#x2019;t play with the characters. If you&#x2019;re allowed to scrap them from your hand when drawn it would still allow those cards to be useful for the pips when battling.
</question>
      <answer>
You cannot scrap cards from your hand for no reason or simply because you&#x2019;d like to, but there are a plethora of effects in the game (such as green battle icons) that allow you to swap cards in and out of your hand.

With Pop a Wheelie, the 2nd attack isn&#x2019;t from the same bot that attacked the turn the card was played, correct? I would need to have another untapped motorcycle make the 2nd attack?
</question>
      <answer>
Correct. If you have another untapped motorcycle on your team, you can attack again. However, note that the first attacker does not have to be a motorcycle.

      <question>
Grapple reads you get an attack/defence bonus for flipping battle icons of "exactly 4 different colors". What happens when you flip MORE than 4 colors during your turn, say green, orange, white, green and black? Does his ability still trigger? And does this also apply to his ability on other side of the card?
</question>
      <answer>
If a number of *colors* other than four colors is flipped, Grapple&#x2019;s bot mode ability will not trigger. For his alt mode ability, you can still scrap your hand, but you will only do damage if you&#x2019;ve scrapped exactly four different battle icon colors.

Editor&#x2019;s note: It&#x2019;s important when considering Grapple&#x2019;s abilities to make a distinction between the number of battle icon *colors* and the number of battle icons. So long as the number of battle icon colors is exactly 4, the number of cards they appear on do not matter. So, in the scenario described in this question, his ability would trigger as four colors appear, even though there are multiple instances of a green battle icon.

Do you have to attach the Battle Master's Upgrade side? My Wife pulled 2 Lionizers in Turbo Sealed but pull no Orange. When I KO'd Lionizer, would she be forced to scrap EM24 IR Laser Launcher, or could she choose not to attach Lionizer?
</question>
      <answer>
Yes, you must attach the Battle Master&#x2019;s Upgrade side. When you attach the Battle Master, you must scrap the older upgrade; in this case, EM24 IR Laser Launcher.

      <question>
If I open a card in a Limited Format that says "grab a card from outside the game" am I allowed to dip into my personal collection for this (assuming I brought it ahead of time) or just the sideboard of my Limited Pool? If I have a lesser collection (or am just lazy), am I allowed to use cards from my Sideboard for my Outside-of-the-Game-Board? Or is this a Head Judge for an event decision?
</question>
      <answer>
For casual play, you are allowed to use whatever parameters your play group has decided on. For competitive play, in Limited, you are only allowed to draw &#x201C;outside the game&#x201D; cards from your Limited pool.

Editor&#x2019;s Note: In our initial ruling, we misstated our answer and accidentally ruled that &#x201C;outside the game&#x201D; cards must be limited to one&#x2019;s sideboard. This is incorrect.

          <tftcg-note>They later changed competitive rules to require battle cards to come from the sideboard. </tftcg-note>

      <question>
Say I play Infiltrate on my turn, then on my opponent's turn they play Focus Fire, which lets them play a second Focus Fire, which then lets them play the 3rd Focus Fire.

If I reveal my Infiltrate and negate their first Focus Fire, does it negate the other 2 as well since the first one is discarded?
</question>
      <answer>
If you negate a Focus Fire, it also negates the ability of Focus Fire to play other instances of Focus Fire, stopping the chain.

Secret Actions say they scrap at the end of my opponent's turn. If I Brainstorm, Secret Action, Peace Through Tyranny, how long does the Secret Action stay out? Will it stay out for my second turn, until it is my opponent's turn, and then scrap at the end of their turn?

It will stay out for your second turn and scrap at the end of your opponent&#x2019;s turn.

If I am playing a team of Decepticon characters, can I still play Press the Advantage? None of my characters would get an attack boost, but a defending Decepticon gets -2 defense?
</question>

Yes, you may play Press the Advantage. You don&#x2019;t have an Autobot to give +2 attack to, but you can still give an enemy Decepticon -2 defense.

How does Alpha Trion&#x2019;s ability interact with Inverted?
</question>

While equipped with inverted, an attacking Alpha Trion may play an action with an orange icon they&#x2019;ve flipped (because it counts as a blue icon).

When Private Pteraxadon is in weapon mode (AKA Binary Edgewing Scythe), it says the defender's base armor value becomes zero during this battle. Does that count any armor bonuses from upgrades as well? Or does it only apply to the printed value on the bot?
</question>

Private Pteraxodon&#x2019;s weapon mode ability specifies that it only applies to an opponent&#x2019;s base defense, so it would not include defense from any upgrades or flipped battle cards.

I have a tapped Flamewar - Veteran Decepticon with 3 life remaining with 2 other untapped characters and a facedown Bolster. My opponent has 3 untapped characters and taps their attacker, declaring Flamewar as my defender. Because the conditions are met, I reveal Bolster and play Multi-Mission Gear onto my Flamewar. That triggers Multi-Mission Gear and allows me to play an action, which I choose to play One Shall Stand, One Shall Fall targeting my Flamewar and one of my opponent's characters. This kills my Flamewar but the attacker still lives. What happens in this scenario? Does my opponent lose their attack because the defender was killed prior to battle cards being flipped? Or does my opponent get to choose another attack target?
</question>
      <answer>
Your opponent has already chosen who they are attacking, so the attack would end because there is no longer a defender.

No, you cannot. KO&#x2019;ing a character is part of Peace Through Tyranny&#x2019;s effect, so it would be too late to reveal your Infiltrate.

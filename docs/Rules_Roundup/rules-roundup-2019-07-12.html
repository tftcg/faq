Shockwave’s ability will trigger 11 times, but if those are the last two characters on the battlefield, your opponent will lose the game because Shockwave has been KO’d by Bombshell’s ability, but Bombshell is not yet KO’d by Shockwave’s ability.

Does Skywarp – Teleporting Seeker’s bot mode ability trigger when playing a Secret Action from hand since the pip color is hidden information from your opponent?

Yes, Skywarp’s bot mode ability would be triggered by a Secret Action as the battle icon color is hidden. It will still trigger if Leap of Faith plays a Secret Action because at the time you play the Secret Action, the Secret Action has no battle icons (it’s not very secret).

Can you scrap cards from your hand? This came up from playing a lot of the Turbo format with my kids. Inevitably someone had one or two cards that you couldn’t play with the characters. If you’re allowed to scrap them from your hand when drawn it would still allow those cards to be useful for the pips when battling.

      <div class="answer">
        
You cannot scrap cards from your hand for no reason or simply because you’d like to, but there are a plethora of effects in the game (such as green battle icons) that allow you to swap cards in and out of your hand.

Grapple reads you get an attack/defence bonus for flipping battle icons of "exactly 4 different colors". What happens when you flip MORE than 4 colors during your turn, say green, orange, white, green and black? Does his ability still trigger? And does this also apply to his ability on other side of the card?

        <span><a href="https://transformerstcg-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033430171-Rules-Roundup-7-12-19"><img src="/images/source-red.svg" title="Rules Roundup 2019-07-12"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        
If a number of *colors* other than four colors is flipped, Grapple’s bot mode ability will not trigger. For his alt mode ability, you can still scrap your hand, but you will only do damage if you’ve scrapped exactly four different battle icon colors.

Editor’s note: It’s important when considering Grapple’s abilities to make a distinction between the number of battle icon *colors* and the number of battle icons. So long as the number of battle icon colors is exactly 4, the number of cards they appear on do not matter. So, in the scenario described in this question, his ability would trigger as four colors appear, even though there are multiple instances of a green battle icon.

For casual play, you are allowed to use whatever parameters your play group has decided on. For competitive play, in Limited, you are only allowed to draw “outside the game” cards from your Limited pool.

When Private Pteraxadon is in weapon mode (AKA Binary Edgewing Scythe), it says the defender's base armor value becomes zero during this battle. Does that count any armor bonuses from upgrades as well? Or does it only apply to the printed value on the bot?

Private Pteraxodon’s weapon mode ability specifies that it only applies to an opponent’s base defense, so it would not include defense from any upgrades or flipped battle cards.

When you "put a cassette from the battlefield under it" does the mini-cassette heal to full or keep its damage/upgrades?

      <div class="answer">
        
All of the damage is removed, and the cassette is essentially healed to full. All upgrades attached to the cassette when it’s moved under its deployer are scrapped.

I have a tapped Flamewar - Veteran Decepticon with 3 life remaining with 2 other untapped characters and a facedown Bolster. My opponent has 3 untapped characters and taps their attacker, declaring Flamewar as my defender. Because the conditions are met, I reveal Bolster and play Multi-Mission Gear onto my Flamewar. That triggers Multi-Mission Gear and allows me to play an action, which I choose to play One Shall Stand, One Shall Fall targeting my Flamewar and one of my opponent's characters. This kills my Flamewar but the attacker still lives. What happens in this scenario? Does my opponent lose their attack because the defender was killed prior to battle cards being flipped? Or does my opponent get to choose another attack target?

      <div class="answer">
        
Your opponent has already chosen who they are attacking, so the attack would end because there is no longer a defender.

Infiltrate and Peace Through Tyranny - since the ruling was made that one can choose if a Secret Action triggers. Can I wait to see if the person playing PTT KO's one of his characters before deciding to reveal Infiltrate?

      <div class="answer">
        
No, you cannot. KO’ing a character is part of Peace Through Tyranny’s effect, so it would be too late to reveal your Infiltrate.
Also, it would just be a straight up super not cool thing to do, man.

      <div class="question">
        If I want to play a Weapon on the upgraded character, do I choose which slot it goes in?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Yes. If you want the Weapon in its Armor slot, put it to the right of Megatron, where an Armor would normally go. Once the Weapon is in a slot, it can’t move to another slot. This means that if you put a Weapon into its Armor slot, you’d have to scrap that Weapon if later you wanted to play an Armor on it.

      <div class="question">
        If I have a Weapon in the upgraded character’s Armor slot and Tooth and Claw is removed from the character, what happens to the Weapon?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        It stays where it is. Once an Upgrade is legally put into a slot, removing what made it legal to put it there doesn’t matter.

                <h3>TRANSFORMERS TCG LIVES ON</h3>
                <p>On SomeDate, July 2020 Wizards of the Coast announced that they were no longer going to create any more releases, citing not enough growth into the broader Transformers fan base, along with COVID-19 difficulties. </p>
                <p>That did not stop the growing community of players who called the game their own. They have continued to play the game, they have continued to host tournaments, they have continued to create content for each other, and they have started to determine their own rules and to create new community cards. </p>
                <p><b>The game continues...</b></p>

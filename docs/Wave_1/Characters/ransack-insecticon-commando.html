      <div class="question">
        
    What happens if I flip Ransack to alt mode and there are no damaged characters?

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        
    In that case, nothing happens. No damage counters are put on Ransack.

      </div>
    </li>
    

    
    <li class="faq_entry">
      <!-- ransack-2 - alt -->
      <div class="question">
        
    What happens if the only damaged characters are enemies? Can I choose one of my characters and
do nothing?

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        
    Yes. You choose any other character, damaged or not. Then move 2 damage counters from that
character onto Ransack fi you can.

      </div>
    </li>
    

    
    <li class="faq_entry">
      <!-- ransack-3 - bot -->
      <div class="question">
        
    How does Ransack’s ability work with Actions or Upgrades that raise his attack?

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        
    Ransack’s ability sets his base attack value, what you’d see printed on the card if it didn’t change.
From there, Actions and Upgrades can raise that value. For example, if Ransack has 5 damage counters,
his base attack would be 5. If he then got a Weapon that gave him +2 attack, his attack would be 7. This
wouldn’t change the number of damage counters on him.
